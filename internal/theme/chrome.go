// A theme's own colours for tuios's furniture, separate from the sixteen the
// panes are painted with.
//
// The sixteen ANSI slots did double duty: they are the emulator's colour table
// and they were also where every chrome colour came from. The accent is
// bright_blue, the focused border is bright_cyan, the mode pills are
// bright_blue, bright_green and yellow, and the notification severities are the
// normal red, yellow, green and blue. So a palette whose accent is amber could
// only have an amber logo by putting amber in bright_blue, which also recolours
// every bold blue a program prints inside a pane. The choice was a faithful
// palette with off-accent chrome, or matching chrome and lying to ls.
//
// A theme may now name these colours directly. Every field is optional and an
// absent one derives exactly as it did before, so a theme file written before
// this existed renders identically.

	// window-management mode. Derived from bright_cyan.

	// Success is the terminal-mode pill, the focused border in terminal mode,
	// and a success notification. Derived from bright_green.
	Success color.Color

	// has, so a panel still reads as raised and a card as inset, and the
	// hierarchy of the text on them is kept. Nil keeps the constant ramp.
