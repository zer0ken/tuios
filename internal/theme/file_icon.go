// The ink a per-type file icon burns on the rail.
//
// The hex a file icon arrives with is absolute. It comes from
// nvim-web-devicons, which picked it against an editor's own dark ground and
// knows nothing about the theme the user is running. Drawn as given, a ruby red
// (#701516) measures 1.3:1 on a dark background and a dotenv yellow (#FAF743)
// measures 1.1:1 on a light one, so one end of the palette or the other is
// simply gone.
//
// So the hue is kept and the luminance is spent. ReadableAt carries the colour
// toward the ground's own text end until it clears MarkFloor, which is the 3:1
// WCAG 2.1 holds a non-text graphic to. An icon is a shape as well as a colour,
// which is why it is held to the mark floor rather than to the 4.5:1 the name
// beside it clears: lifting every colour to text contrast is what turns the
// ruby red into pink and loses the thing the colour was for.

// RailGround is what the rail's rows are drawn on.
//
// The rail paints no fill of its own, so a row sits on whatever the terminal's
// background is, which is the theme's when a theme is on. Without a theme the
// ground is the host terminal's own background, which only a client knows (a
// server process has several, one per client), so a client that has asked
// passes it to GroundUIOn and RailRuleOn itself. This package on its own falls
// back to the chrome ramp's canvas, which is what every constant ink in the
// rail was picked against.

// fileIconMemo holds the answers per ground. ReadableAt walks up to sixteen
// blends measuring a contrast ratio at each, and the icons are read once per
// drawn row on every rail rebuild, so the walk is done once per colour and kept.
//
// Four grounds rather than one because a rail draws on more than one at a time:
// the resting rows sit on the terminal's background and the row under the
// pointer sits on a band of its own, and a single slot would be cleared and
// refilled on every one of those transitions.
