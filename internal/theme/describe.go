// feedback: the value it had just sent, echoed. Whether the green it chose is
// legible on the background it chose was not answerable from outside the
// process, and a theme whose colours sit on top of each other looks exactly
// like a theme that failed to apply.
//
// Describe answers both halves. The colours are what the theme actually holds,
// so a palette that did not apply reads back as the old one; the ratios are
// measured against the theme's own background, so an unreadable choice is
// reported as unreadable before anyone has to look at it.
