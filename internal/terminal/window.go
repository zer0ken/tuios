// ioMu guards the emulator cell buffer: the PTY reader and the daemon output
// path write it, Resize reallocates it, and the renderer reads it.
//
// It is NOT reentrant, and that is not a style preference but a hard
// correctness rule. sync.RWMutex starves readers once a writer is queued, so a
// goroutine that holds RLockIO and then takes RLockIO again on the same window
// parks behind that queued writer while still holding the read lock the writer
// is waiting for. Neither side can proceed and the process wedges at zero CPU.
// A live PTY produces output constantly, so the writer is queued often and the
// window for this is wide.
//
// The rule for callers: never take either lock while already holding either
// lock on the same window, and do not call a helper that takes one from inside
// a locked region. Where a value is needed on both sides of that boundary,
// follow the split this package already uses (a locking entry point plus a
// lock-free variant for callers that are already inside, as with
// ScrollbackLenSync and ScrollbackLen), or hoist the read out of the locked region entirely.
