// The post-capture preview panel.
//
// The body is the captured cells drawn straight back with the terminal's own
// text rendering, in their exact colours. For the content this is not a
// degraded preview, it is the most faithful one there is: the same renderer
// the content came from is drawing it again. What it cannot show is the pixel
// dressing, and one quiet line says so rather than the panel pretending.
//
// A kitty host gets the same panel with the rendered PNG drawn over the capture
// rows, which are blanked for it so the picture is not laid on top of the same
// capture in text (see screenshot_graphics.go). Sixel gets the text tier and
// nothing else, because sixel cannot delete a placement, which is why the
// launcher icons already skip it.

// 80 columns, so the panel is sized to show most of one without scrolling and
