// The screen saver animates a snapshot of the screen after a spell with no
// input, and stops on the first key or pointer movement.
//
// It costs nothing at idle. Two rules make that true, and both matter:
//
//   - Arming is one deferred timer, never a standing tick. Input records the
//     time and starts a timer only if none is in flight; when that timer fires
//     early it re-arms for the remainder. So at most one timer exists, and it
//     fires at most once per idle delay however hard the keyboard is used.
//   - While running, the saver drives its own frames through screensaverFrame,
//     the way autoScrollTick does. It adds no term to tickNeedsWork and none to
//     needsRender, so the maintenance tick's idle path is untouched, byte for
//     byte, whether the saver is armed or not.

// screensaverArmMsg is the deferred idle timer firing. It is not proof that
// the session is idle: the timer may have been armed before later input, which
// is why the handler re-checks the elapsed time.
