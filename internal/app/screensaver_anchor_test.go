// The saver must start without moving the screen.
//
// The engine places a capture by anchor: it measures the block the capture
// fills and slides that block to a corner. A screen is not a block. Its top
// rows are often empty, so the block is shorter than the screen, and any anchor
// that pins the block's top edge lifts the whole picture by the difference.
// What the user sees is the screen jumping upwards the moment the saver starts.
//
// These tests measure that jump on real composed screens and require it to be
// zero. The measurement is the offset at which the most captured glyphs line
// up, so a frame that is merely close scores its real displacement instead of
// passing.
//
// Negative control: put AnchorNW back in screensaverBuild and
// TestSaverDoesNotMoveAScreenWithEmptyTopRows reports offset row -3. Drop the
// screensaverFit call and TestSaverKeepsTheTopLeftOnATallerCanvas reports
// offset row +4, TestSaverKeepsTheTopLeftOnAShorterCanvas offset row -4. All
// three compile and all three fail on the number.

// The effect these tests run. highlight is the one effect that never moves a
// character and never hides one, so its first frame is the captured screen and
// any displacement in it is placement, not animation. See effectOpenings.
