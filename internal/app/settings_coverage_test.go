// TestSettingsPanelReachesEveryOption is the guard this branch was opened for.

// The panel was hand-written and had drifted to 54 rows against a registry of
// 91 options: everything added after a row was last written was reachable by an
// agent over the control protocol and by a person only by editing the file.
// Nothing failed when the two parted, because nothing tied them together.
//
// This is that tie. An option with no row and no entry in settingsUIExcluded
// fails here, so an option cannot be added in future without someone deciding,
// in this file, how a person reaches it.
