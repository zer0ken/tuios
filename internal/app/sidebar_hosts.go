// Federation in the client: the rail draws every machine's sessions as one
// group per machine, this machine first, in an order that does not move.
//
// The one rule this file exists to keep is that no part of it touches the
// network from the Update goroutine. The daemon holds the links; the client
// asks it for a snapshot inside a tea.Cmd, stores what comes back, and the rail
// renders from the stored snapshot alone. A host that is powered off cannot
// slow a frame down, because a frame never waits on one.
//
// A client whose daemon has no hosts configured stops polling after the first
// answer, so the default install pays one verb call at attach and nothing after.
// The daemon pushes MsgHostsChanged when its table changes, which is what
// starts the poll again when the first host is added.
//
// The second rule is that a row stays where it is. Switching onto a session on
// build used to make build the main group at the top of the section and push
// this machine's sessions down into a group of their own, so the row the user
// had just clicked moved out from under the pointer and every other row moved
// with it. Now the machine groups keep one order whatever the client is
// attached to: this machine first, then the other machines in the daemon's
// sorted order, overlaid with the order the user dragged them into. The
// attached session is marked current in place, under whichever machine holds
// it, which is the same promise BuildSessionTree makes for a session switch on
// one machine.
