// The preview's pixel tier.
//
// Kitty graphics buy exactly one thing here: seeing the pixel frame, the wash
// and the shadow before leaving the terminal. Everything else the panel does
// is text, works on a plain xterm, and is not a fallback: the cells in the
// body are the same cells the content was drawn from.
//
// The transmit and place helpers are the launcher's, generalised. The preview
// takes its own reserved image id rather than sharing the launcher's counter,
// so a panel that is open at the same time cannot delete the other's picture.
//
// Sixel gets no pixel tier. Sixel has no way to delete a placement, which is
// why the launcher icons already skip it, and a preview panel that can be
// dragged and closed needs exactly that.

// screenshotImageID is the reserved kitty image id for the preview. The
// launcher's icons count up from 0xF000_0000, so this sits sixteen million ids
// above the base it starts at: the two cannot meet without a session drawing
// that many distinct icons, and neither can meet a pane's own images, which a
// guest is handed counting up from 1.

// nothing left to give when the box turns out a cell or two larger than this
// guess. Two times the body is a few hundred kilobytes at most, against the two

// the picture; if the two worked it out separately they could disagree and the

//
// The picture keeps its own proportions, so it does not fill the body, and the
// slack has to go somewhere. It goes on both sides of the picture rather than
// all of it on the right. The panel cannot narrow to the picture, because the
// header, the file path and the footer all need the panel's width and a
// thirteen-column panel would cut every one of them; so the margin exists
// whatever is done with it, and a margin split in two reads as a frame while a
// margin all on one side reads as a picture that missed. The rows are the other
