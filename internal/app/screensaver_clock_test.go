// The saver's engine has to run on the rate this program paints at.
//
// tuiffects keeps a virtual clock: it steps a fixed fraction of a second once
// per engine update, so a run is reproducible from its seed and an effect
// written in seconds still lasts that many seconds. The fraction is one over
// the frame rate, and NewEngine assumes sixty.
//
// The saver does not paint at sixty. It ticks at the session's NormalFPS, which
// max_fps sets and which is 240 on a machine whose screen will take it. Left
// at the library's default, the engine's clock ran four times faster than the
// wall: matrix rained for a quarter of the seconds it was asked for,
// thunderstorm stormed for a quarter, and tuffbaby played its ten frame a
// second clip at forty.
//
// Negative control: dropping the engine.Clock line from screensaverBuild
// reports "one second of paint moved the clock 4.000 seconds, want 1.000" at
// 240 and 2.000 at 120, and TestSaverRunsTheRainForItsFullTime reports the
// whole matrix run lasting 5.84 seconds of paint at 240, and 11.21 at 120,
// against the 15 seconds of rain alone that it asked for. The 60 case passes
// either way, which is what made the fault invisible. Run.
