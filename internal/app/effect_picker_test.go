// "The screen stays visible from the start" is stronger than anything else the
// picker says. It carries no "it depends on your screen", so it has to hold on
// every screen, and a measurement of one screen cannot earn it. That is how
// rings, vhstape, waves and thunderstorm came to carry it: all four measured
// zero under a metric that asked when the screen first read well, and the first
// three then took the screen away for twenty-three, twelve and seven seconds.
//
// So this runs every effect flagged keepsScreen to its end and holds it to the
// whole claim on every frame: every captured glyph that is legible on the
// screen itself stays legible, in its own place, no share of it missing. Six
// screen shapes, from a phone-sized terminal to a wide one, because the effects
// that failed this failed it by size.
//
// "Legible on the screen itself" is the capture's own contrast, and it matters
// once the capture has colour. The dock's hairline and the rounded caps of its
// pills are drawn below the readability floor on purpose, so no effect can make
// them readable and a claim that counted them failed on the untouched screen.
// It passed for as long as it did only because test frames were stripped of
// colour, which made every glyph the default foreground.
//
// highlight passes. It sweeps a band of brighter colour over text that never
// moves.
