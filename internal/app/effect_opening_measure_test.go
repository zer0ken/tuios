// screen, which is a few seconds nobody needs on an ordinary run.

// over: a prompt, a run of output, and colour on some of it but not all. It is
// one screen at one size, and the picker only takes a band from it. See the

// TestMeasureEffectOpenings measures how long each effect hides the screen.
//
// The metric is the last frame at which fewer than nine cells in ten of the
// capture's glyph cells are readable, plus one: the frame the screen is back
// and stays back. A cell is readable when it shows its captured symbol, in its
// captured place, in a colour that stands off the background it is drawn on.
//
// Both halves of that are load bearing, and each one alone gets an effect
// wrong.
//
// Symbols alone call burn instant. burn holds every character in its final
// position from the first frame and darkens it towards the background, so what
// is on screen is a flat sheet for eleven seconds that a symbols-only metric
// scores as a perfect screen.
//
// Colour equality overcorrects. highlight never moves a character and never
// hides one: it only brightens the colour each is already drawn in. Requiring
// the captured colour back scored it as a screen you cannot read for eighty
// frames, and thunderstorm, which also only recolours, the same way for nine
// hundred. Contrast separates the two, because highlight and thunderstorm keep
// their characters legible against what is behind them and burn does not.
//
// The first readable frame is not the metric either. rings, vhstape and waves
// all start from the untouched screen and take it away afterwards, so the first
// frame that reads well is frame 0 for all three, while the screen is in fact
// gone for eleven, twelve and seven seconds. The last unreadable frame is what
// a user waits for.
