// TestScreensaverStartsOverTheRealComposedScreen is the only end-to-end cover
// of the start path, and it exists because every failure in that path is
// silent: startScreensaver returns false and the saver simply never appears,
// with nothing said about why. A nil capture, an effect that will not build, a
// canvas that disagrees with the grid, all look identical from outside.
//
// It also pins the thing the canvas sizing was fixed for: the composed grid and
// the render size must agree, and the effect must be built over the grid's own
// dimensions.
//
// Negative control: making composedGrid return nil, or building the canvas at a
// size the capture does not have, fails this.
