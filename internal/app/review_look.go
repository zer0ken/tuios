// The review overlay's colours, and what it keeps of a diff between frames.
//
// The overlay covers the whole screen and every cell of it is painted: a
// cell left on the default background would take the desktop's ground, or
// the host terminal's, through a full-screen view. The ground is the one a
// pane shows code on, so the diff reads like the file in the theme the
// person chose:
//
//   - the pane background (appearance.pane_background, or the default for
//     every surface) when one is set;
//   - otherwise the theme's own background, when a theme is set;
//   - otherwise the chrome's surface, the ground every other overlay uses.
//
// The chrome palette's inks were picked against its own dark surface. On
// any other ground they are measured again, and lifted where they would not
// read, so a light theme gets dark text rather than the chrome's cream.

// reviewLook is the palette and diff theme for one ground, kept until the
// theme or the pane background changes.
