// Which machine opens a link is the whole of this file, and it is the question
// the rest of the feature exists to be careful about.
//
// There are two machines. The panes, the daemon and the tuios client process
// all run on one of them; call it the pane machine. The person looking at the
// screen sits at the other; call it the viewer machine. On a local run they are
// the same machine and nothing is interesting. Under `tuios ssh` and
// `tuios-web` they are not: the client code runs on the server, so calling
// xdg-open there opens a browser on the server's console, in front of nobody.
// That is the mistake this file is written to not make.
//
// The two kinds of link fall on opposite sides of that split:
//
//   - A file:// link names a file on the pane machine. The client process is
//     always on the pane machine, in every deployment tuios has, so the path
//     can be stat'd here and opened here. A pane is the right place to open it
//     in, because a pane is a window onto exactly that machine.
//
//   - An http:// or https:// link has to be opened by a browser the person can
//     see, which lives on the viewer machine. tuios has no way to run anything
//     there: there is no escape sequence for "open this URL", and adding a
//     protocol for running commands on the viewer's box is a much larger thing
//     to own than a link. So a local client opens it and a remote one does not
//     pretend to. What a remote client can do is put the address on the
//     viewer's clipboard, because OSC 52 rides the same stream the frame does
//     and lands on the viewer machine, which is the whole point of it.

// linkFilePath returns the local filesystem path a file:// link names, and
// whether it names one. A file:// URL with a host that is not this machine is
// somebody else's filesystem and gets no special treatment.

// A link's address is attacker-controlled. Any program running in a pane can
// print an OSC 8 escape carrying any URI at all, and unlike a bare URL, which
// this file's scanner only ever produces from three schemes, a marked link's
// address never passed through anything that looked at it.
//
// What is on the other end of openInOSViewer is xdg-open, `open`, or the
// Windows protocol handler, and all three resolve a scheme to whatever
// application the desktop registered for it. So an unfiltered address is a way
// for a program in a pane to start an arbitrary registered application, with an
// argument it chose, from one click on text whose visible label it also chose.
// The label above the run names the real target, which is what makes this a
// click the user consents to rather than one they are tricked into; the list
// below is what stops the consent from being worth more than it looks.
//
// Nothing is executed through a shell either way: openInOSViewer builds an argv
// and never a command line, so a semicolon or a backtick in an address is one
// more character of one argument. The risk this list closes is the scheme, not
// the quoting.
//
// The set is the one a terminal is actually asked for. file:// is absent
// because it never reaches here: OpenLink routes it above, to a stat and a pane
// on the machine the file is on. An application's own scheme is refused and
// copied instead, which loses nothing a paste cannot do.
