// The effect picker is the theme picker's third sibling. screensaver.effect
// used to accept five values and a cycler stepped through them; it accepts
// thirty-six now, and a control that costs one keypress per stop is the wrong
// shape for a set that size. The next largest closed list in the panel is ten.
//
// Names alone would not fix it. orbittingvolley, synthgrid, binarypath and
// errorcorrect say nothing about what lands on the screen, so this picker does
// what the other two do: it previews. The theme picker recolours the whole
// screen, the glyph set picker redraws the chrome, and this one runs the effect
// over the screen you opened it from.
//
// The capture is the real composed screen, taken once when the picker opens and
// reused for every selection. Nothing else would be honest: the effects resolve
// each character back to the colour it was captured with, and several of them
// behave differently over a cell that carries its own background, so an effect
// previewed over invented sample text is a preview of a screen nobody has.
//
// It costs nothing when it is shut. The preview drives its own frames the way
// the saver does, so the maintenance tick never learns it exists.

// effectPreviewFrameMsg asks the running preview for its next frame. gen is the
// generation it was scheduled for: a message from a preview that has already
// been closed and reopened is dropped rather than starting a second chain of

// putting a number back on the panel.
//
// The metric is the last frame at which fewer than nine cells in ten of the
// capture's glyph cells are readable, plus one. A cell is readable when it
// shows its captured symbol, in its captured place, in a colour that stands off
// the background it is drawn on. TestMeasureEffectOpenings carries the argument
// for both halves and re-measures the table.
//
// What frames is not is a promise about anyone's screen. Several of these
// effects do work per character, so the wait scales with how much text is on
// screen and how big the screen is. Measured over four screens, pour ran from
// 3.1 seconds on a bare prompt to 97.8 seconds at 200x50 on a full one, rain
// from 2.6 to 65.2, and laseretch from 6.4 to 133.3. Others hardly move:
// fireworks stayed inside 18.9 to 20.3 and matrix inside 25.1 to 37.6. So no
// single scale factor fits them, and a number taken from here and shown to a
// user is a measurement of a screen that is not theirs.
//
// What survives is the order and the size of the wait. wipe is at the top on
// every screen measured and swarm at the bottom, and an effect that hides the
// screen for most of a minute does that on any screen. So the picker takes a
// band from this table and never a time, and the panel says the time depends on
// the screen. effectOpeningBandOf is the only reader.
//
// Measuring the real screen instead was considered and does not fit: it means
// running each effect to its end, and at 200x50 four of them are still going
// after two minutes of animation. The picker would have to sit there.
//
// TestEffectOpeningTableCoversEveryEffect fails the build when the engine gains
// or loses an effect, so a version bump cannot leave a row with no band.
