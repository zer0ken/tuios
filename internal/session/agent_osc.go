// harness's habits: a determinate or indeterminate bar is the program saying it
// is busy, clearing the bar is it saying it stopped, and the error state is it
// saying the operation failed. The warning state is the only one that carries a
// judgement, and a program that flags its own progress as needing attention is
// asking for a human, which is what needs_input means here.

// Clearing maps to idle rather than done because the sequence says the work
// stopped and says nothing about whether it succeeded. done is a claim only the
// harness itself can honestly make, through a report.
