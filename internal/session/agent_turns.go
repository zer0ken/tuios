// Finished turns, counted.
//
// done used to be the only state that meant "the agent finished", and only an
// explicit report or the Claude transcript produces it. A Codex or Gemini pane
// with no hook went working, then unknown on the silence timer, and never told
// anybody it was done. herdr's answer is that done is simply "back at rest and
// not yet looked at", and it works for every agent.
//
// So the daemon counts turns. Every time a window goes from working to a rest
// state (idle, done or unknown) after working for at least agentMinTurn, its
// CompletionSeq goes up by one. A client compares that number with the one it
// had when its user last focused the pane, which makes "finished and unread"
// a per-client fact, as it has to be: two people attached to one session have
// not both looked at a pane because one of them did.
//
// The minimum is what keeps a redraw from counting. A pane the detector owns
// goes to working on any output from the agent, a cursor blink included, and
// back to unknown when the silence timer runs; a real turn does not take less
// than a few seconds. An explicit done needs no minimum, since it is the agent
// saying so.
