// For a state the agent or a rule said about itself (a report, a hook, a
// transcript, an OSC sequence, a screen rule), the evidence is the saying, and
// AgentStateAt is when it was said. A title or screen look that only reads
// back the claim it already holds does not restamp it (see lookRepeatsClaim),
// so a spinner left in a title ages like the silence it is.
//
// For a state the daemon inferred, detect or stall, the evidence is the pane
// itself. The detector says working from presence and the silence timer says
// unknown or idle from quiet, and both are measured against the pane's output:
// applyStallHeuristic takes the later of AgentStateAt and the last output
// (stalledAt). The age follows the same rule, so a pane that keeps printing
// reads fresh rather than aging from the moment the detector first saw it.
