// Positive idle evidence, held until it has been seen enough times to trust.
//
// A title or screen rule that says idle is reading a prompt box or a rest
// glyph, and those are on screen in the gaps of a turn too: Claude Code keeps
// its prompt box under the spinner the whole time it works, and a harness that
// redraws can show a frame with no spinner for a moment. Publishing the first
// such frame flaps the pane from working to idle and back, and every flap is a
// finished turn to anything counting them.
//
// So a pane that is working moves to idle only when the idle reading holds on
// idleConfirmCount further looks spaced at least idleConfirmInterval apart, or
// when it has held for idleConfirmCap, whichever comes first. The gate
// schedules those looks itself, because a pane at rest emits nothing that
// would trigger one. Any look that reads something other than idle cancels the
// wait. A pane that was not working is at no risk of a flap, so its idle is
// published at once.
//
// A harness that has only just been seen in a pane is also given
// agentStartupGrace before any idle reading counts: a starting TUI paints its
// frame in pieces, and a half-painted frame can look like an empty prompt box.
// These are herdr's numbers.
