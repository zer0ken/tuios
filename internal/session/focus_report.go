// Focus report on enable.
//
// A program that turns on focus event reporting (DECSET 1004) expects to be
// told at once whether it has focus: xterm, kitty and ghostty all send the
// current state on the set, so the program does not have to guess until the
// focus next changes. The daemon's emulator answers for the pane, as it does
// every other query, and client emulators drain their responses, so the report
// goes out once.
//
// Only the focused state is reported. tuios does not yet report focus changes
// to panes, so telling an unfocused pane it is unfocused would leave it
// believing that after the person moved to it. A pane that is not told assumes
// it has focus, which is what it did before.

// SetHostShownProbe installs what reports whether the session is on a screen
// someone could be looking at: an attached TUI client whose host terminal has
// not reported losing focus. The daemon installs it on every session.

// noteFocusReporting is called by vtWriter after each write to the emulator,

// on now. On the write that turns it on it sends the focus-in report when the
// pane has focus.

// The focus check takes the session's state lock and the daemon's client lock,
// so it runs off the writer goroutine: a holder of either that waits for the
// emulator to drain must not wait on this goroutine in turn.
