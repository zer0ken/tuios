// Asking the person a question, and getting the answer back.
//
// An agent that needs a decision had two poor options: stop and wait in its own
// pane, where nobody may be looking, or mail human and poll its inbox. ask-human
// is one call for both cases. It puts the question in the Inbox as an ask item
// with the answers it takes, and blocks until the person picks one or the wait
// runs out:
//
//   - When a client the person holds shows the asking pane, that client opens
//     the Inbox on the question at once, which is the popup: a key picks the
//     answer. Anywhere else the item waits in the Inbox with the usual alert,
//     so a question never steals the keyboard from someone typing elsewhere.
//   - When nobody is attached, the item waits in the Inbox for the next
//     attach. The Inbox is the one place to look either way.
//   - When the wait runs out, the call returns status pending and the question
//     stays. The answer, when it comes, is mailed to the asking pane from
//     human, marked verified_human, so wait-for agent-message picks it up. A
//     caller with no pane calls ask-human again with the request id to wait
//     for it or read it.
//   - When the caller goes away while it waits, which the daemon learns only
//     when the reply cannot be written, an answer to a question from a pane
//     is mailed there the same way (askReply).
//
// Who may do what, and how it is enforced:
//
//   - Only answer-ask puts an answer in, and it takes the proof reply-approval
//     takes: the nonce of a client attached right now, from a process outside
//     every pane (human_sender.go, human_origin.go). An agent cannot answer
//     its own question or another's. The answer must be one of the options
//     the question offered, and when the client names the line it showed, the
//     line must be the question's, so an answer only ever answers what the
//     person read.
//   - A caller inside a pane asks only as its own pane: naming another is
//     forbidden, so no agent can have an answer mailed into another agent's
//     inbox. It may come back for an answer only to a question its own pane
//     asked. A caller outside every pane is the user's own script and may name
//     any pane, or none.
//   - ask-human is refused over a link. A question is put to the person at
//     this machine's clients by something on this machine.
//   - The question and each option must be one line of printable text that
//     the Inbox shows exactly as written, the check a held approval's line
//     passes, so nothing is cut, masked or rewritten between the asker and
//     the person. Questions from outside every pane are capped per session,
//     and a pane has one open question at a time: a new one supersedes it.
