// This file implements the cross-agent verbs: who is here (list-agents), leaving
// a message (send-agent-message), reading one (read-agent-messages), and asking
// an agent a question and waiting for it to answer (ask-agent).
//
// The addressing scheme is deliberately not a new one. An agent is a window, and
// a window is already addressable by uuid, unique id prefix, list index or exact
// name, which is what every other window-targeted verb takes. Inventing a second
// namespace for agents would mean two ways to name the same pane and a rule for
// when they disagree. Discovery is list-agents, so an agent finds its
// correspondents rather than being told them, and $TUIOS_PANE_ID is its own
// address.
//
// An inbox therefore lives and dies with its window. A message addressed to a
// window that has since closed reads back undeliverable rather than being handed
// to whatever pane later takes that name.

// agentRestStates are the states that mean an agent is not mid-turn, so a
// question sent to it will be read rather than typed over whatever it is doing.
// errored is in the set on purpose: an agent that stopped on an error is at its
// prompt and can be told about it.
//
// needs_input is not in the set. An agent on needs_input is most often sitting
// on a permission menu, and text typed there is read as the answer to the menu:
// the question approves or denies whatever the agent asked for. ask-agent
// refuses such a pane with agent_blocked unless the caller passes allow_blocked,
// and list-agents reports it as not ready.

	// unknown is not in the set. It is what the silence timer writes to a pane
	// that said nothing for the stall window when the screen showed nothing a
	// rule knows, and silence is also what a long tool call looks like, so
	// typing at such a pane can land in the middle of a turn. A harness with
	// rules that read its prompt box reaches idle instead, and a caller that
	// knows better passes force. It stays on the rail as a display state.
	//
	// fanReadyStates in verb_worktree.go is a subset of this set: it also
	// leaves out errored and none, because fan types a first prompt into an
	// agent it just started, and neither of those says the agent reached its
	// prompt. Neither set holds needs_input or unknown.
}

// agentReady reports whether a window's agent state is in the given ready set,
// with one exception for unknown. A harness whose manifest has an idle rule
// shows positive evidence when it is at its prompt, so for it unknown stays not
// ready. A harness without one can never reach idle from its screen, and
