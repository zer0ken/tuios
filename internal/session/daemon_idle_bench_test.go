// What the daemon costs when nobody is doing anything.
//
// The client's idle cost is a defended invariant: BenchmarkIdleTick pins it at
// zero work and zero renders per tick, and a change that moves it is reverted.
// The daemon has no such guard, and unlike the client it is not driven by
// output at all: agentMonitor (daemon.go) runs on a 2 second ticker whatever
// the panes are doing, and every tick walks every session's every window,
// resolves each one's foreground process, and does it inside the session state
// lock.
//
// That makes the daemon's floor O(panes) per two seconds, forever, on a machine
// where every pane is a shell sitting at a prompt. These benchmarks price the
// two halves of it separately, because they scale differently and only one of
// them is Go code: the walk itself, and one process resolution, which on Linux
// is four reads out of procfs.
//
// Benchmark only. The pane counts build real PTYs, so the setup is the
// expensive part; keep the counts to the ones that answer the question.

// TestAgentDetectSweepIsIdempotentWhenIdle is the invariant the benchmark above
// is measuring against, and the one worth defending: a second sweep over an
// unchanged session must find nothing to change. If it ever reports work on a
// steady session, the daemon is republishing state to every attached client
// every two seconds for no reason, and the benchmark would be measuring that
// rather than the idle floor.
