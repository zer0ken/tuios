// The section used to read the filesystem in the client. That was the same
// machine as the pane for as long as a pane could only be on this machine, and
// federation ended it: a client attached to a session on another host listed its
// own disk and reported that the pane's directory did not exist. The daemon that
// owns the pane owns the disk the pane is on, so the listing is asked for here.
//
// The spoof verdict comes back with it for the same reason, and it is the more
// important half. It is a comparison between what a pane announced and where its
// shell actually is, and only this side holds both: the announcement arrived in
// the window state, and the shell is this daemon's own child. A client that
// tried to compute it for a pane on another machine would be reading a pid that
