// Session-side hooks.
//
// Hooks used to be wired entirely into the client, so a session running
// detached under the daemon fired none at all: a pane could be created, exit,
// or finish an agent turn with nobody attached and no hook would run. That is
// the opposite of what a hook is for, because the detached session is exactly
// the one a program is watching instead of a person.
//
// The rule applied here is that a hook fires from the side that owns the fact.
//
//   - The window set, the focused window, the current workspace and a pane's
//     agent state are the daemon's. It owns them whether or not anybody is
//     attached, so it fires their hooks. A client attached to a daemon session
//     no longer fires them (see FireHookContext in internal/app), which is also
//     what makes three attached clients produce one firing rather than three.
//   - A client's viewport size, its attach and its detach belong to that one
//     client. They stay client-side: three clients attaching is three attaches,
//     and the command has to run on the machine the person is sitting at. The
//     layout stays client-side too, because tiling runs in the attached
//     renderer and no daemon-side operation can change it.
//
// A standalone tuios (no daemon) is unaffected: it is the whole system, so it
// keeps firing everything itself.
//
// Firing happens off the session's event sink, which is fed by the state diff
// in state_events.go. The diff runs once per state convergence however the
// mutation arrived, so a hook fires exactly once no matter how many clients are
// attached or which one made the change.

// sessionHookEvents maps a daemon stream event to the hook event it raises. An
// event that is not in this map raises no hook, which is how the high-frequency
// output and bell events cost nothing.
