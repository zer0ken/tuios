// Naming a repository to a daemon that may be on another machine.
//
// new-worktree, fan and start-agent all take a repository. On one machine the
// caller names it by a directory, repo. From another machine a directory
// means nothing, so the caller names it by its origin URL, repo_url, and this
// daemon finds its own checkout of that repository: under repos_root when the
// caller names one, else under the usual source directories of this
// machine's home. With clone and no checkout found, it clones one.
//
// What this lets a caller do that it could not before: read which of this
// machine's directories hold a checkout of a URL it already knows, and, with
// clone, make git fetch a network URL into a new directory. Both are less
// than what the same caller can already do with new-window and a command, so
// neither widens a link or pane caller's reach. clone is still checked
// against the link policy's open capability below.

// Link capabilities the repository and worktree verbs check at the point they
// act, on top of the check every verb gets before its handler runs
// (link_policy.go). A clone starts a program, git, so it is open, the
// capability that starts sessions and windows. Reading a worktree's files
// out is write: a machine that may type into a shell here can read every one
// of them already, and list, which only reads screens, must not.
