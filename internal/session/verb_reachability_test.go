// This file answers for the socket what the reachability table answers for the
// keyboard: does the verb do anything?
//
// Every other test here calls a verb it is about and checks what that verb did.
// A verb nobody wrote a test for is dispatched by nothing and asserted by
// nothing, so its handler can be replaced with one that returns an empty result
// and the package stays green. Eight verbs were in that state.
//
// So this runs every example in the registry against a real daemon and checks
// the one thing a dead handler cannot fake: that the call produced a result
// with fields in it, and that the fields the verb's own schema names are among
// them. It does not check the values. Values belong to the tests that own them.

// exampleOutcome is what one registry example does against the fixture below.
// Success needs no entry: a verb whose example works is the normal case, and
// the assertions do the rest. Anything else is written down here, so a verb
// that starts failing, or stops failing, is a test failure and not a silence.
