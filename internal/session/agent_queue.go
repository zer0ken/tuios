// The delivery queue: messages for the agent in a pane, typed as a prompt the
// moment the agent comes to rest.
//
// A message is queued with queue-prompt (verb_queue.go), or by another part of
// the daemon through queuePrompt, which is how send-review hands over its
// notes. Nothing polls. The queue acts on the agent-state events the session
// sink already produces (noteQueueEvent, called beside the Inbox's own
// noteSessionEvent), and a daemon with nothing queued and nothing typed costs
// two atomic loads per event. A timer exists only for a pane that has
// something queued.
//
// Delivery, one entry at a time per pane:
//
//   - The pane must be ready the way fan judges a fresh agent ready
//     (agentReady with fanReadyStates): idle or done, and unknown only for a
//     harness whose rules can never show idle. It must have been in that state
//     for queueRest, and, after an earlier delivery, have reached it after that
//     delivery was typed, so the next entry waits for the next rest. When the
//     last entry was typed is kept per pane (typedStamp), not per queue, so an
//     entry queued after the queue emptied still waits for that rest.
//   - A pane whose harness cannot show working (the prompt gate counts its
//     output as taking a prompt) may never change state after taking one: an
//     unknown pane stays unknown. For it a rest is also output printed after
//     the last entry was typed, followed by queueQuiet of silence. Only such a
//     pane with something queued is looked at on a timer.
//   - The entry's origin is checked again (queueOriginRefusal): a pane's
//     grants as they are now, a link's policy as it is now. A refusal drops
//     the entry and logs it; nothing is typed.
//   - refuseBlockedAgent runs right before typing, for every entry, so queued
//     text never answers a prompt.
//   - The text is typed by typeFirstPrompt, the path fan uses: paste, Enter,
//     then the prompt gate (prompt_gate.go) waits for evidence the agent took
//     it.
//   - Taken: the entry is removed. Stalled: the entry is kept, marked stalled,
//     and never typed again, and the Inbox gets a question on the pane's
//     blocking key. A stalled entry holds the entries behind it until the pane
//     next shows working (the agent took it late, or the person dealt with the
//     pane), which drops it, or until someone cancels it. Either way the next
//     entry still waits for a rest reached after the stalled one was typed.
//
// A queue is memory only. It is dropped when the daemon stops, when its pane
// closes, when the agent leaves the pane (state none), and when its session
// ends. An entry a pane queued is dropped when that pane closes.
