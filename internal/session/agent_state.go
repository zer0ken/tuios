// applyStallHeuristic moves any window that has been silently working for at
// least stall into AgentStateIdle, and reports how many it moved. It is the
// fallback for agents that do not report their own state: a pane that reported
// working but has produced no output for the stall window has most likely gone
// idle, so it is demoted rather than left looking busy forever.
//
// Silence on its own is not evidence of finishing, and that is why look exists.
// A harness waiting on a human paints its question and then emits nothing at
// all, no title and no progress sequence, which is byte for byte the same
// silence as a harness that finished. Demoting on the timer alone therefore
// prints idle over a pane that is blocked, and idle reads as "fine and done" and
// raises no alert, so the user is told the opposite of the truth at exactly the
// moment the feature exists to serve.
//
// look is given each stalled pane's PTY and reports whether the screen tier
// found a rule matching it. A pane whose screen answers is left alone: the
// answer came from looking, and looking beats a timer. A pane whose screen
// answered nothing is demoted to unknown rather than idle: the screen was
// read, it said nothing, and idle would say nothing needs you when nothing here
// knows that. A nil look restores the timer-only behaviour, which writes idle,
// the best available when there is nothing to read at all.
//
// It is deliberately conservative and strictly secondary to explicit reporting:
//
//   - It only ever reads AgentStateWorking and only ever writes AgentStateIdle
//     or AgentStateUnknown. Any window in any other state is untouched, so an
//     explicit needs_input, done, or errored report is never overridden.
//   - The silence clock is the later of the window's last output and the time
//     its working state was set, so an agent that is genuinely working (and thus
//     producing output) is never demoted, and a working report just made is given
//     the full stall window before it can be demoted.
//   - It never promotes a pane into working; only an explicit report does that.
//
// Those three rules are why it writes state directly instead of going through
// ApplyAgentReport's precedence gate: reading only working and writing only idle
// is already narrower than the gate, and gating it would silently stop it
// demoting a reported working state, which is the case it exists for. It does
// record itself as the window's source afterwards, so get-agent-state can say
// the idle came from the silence timer rather than from the agent.
//
// now and stall are passed in, and lastOutput returns the unix-nano time of a
// PTY's most recent output (0 when unknown), so the whole rule is deterministic
// and unit-testable without real timers. A stall <= 0 disables the heuristic.
