// The pane's window title as an agent-state signal.
//
// tuios has always parsed OSC 0 and OSC 2 and kept the string for the window's
// name, and no tier ever read it for what it says about the agent. The agents
// are already writing to it: Claude Code puts a spinner there while it works,
// Codex writes that an action is required when it blocks. It is the cheapest
// signal in the building, one short string the program chose to publish, and
// it was going in the bin.
//
// It is filed under the OSC source because that is what it is: an escape
// sequence the program emitted about itself, alongside the progress sequence
// already read there. It is not the screen tier, which reads a rendered frame
// the program never meant as a report.
//
// It never creates a claim. A title proves that something set a title, not
// that the something is an agent, and any program can set any string. So a
// pane no other tier has recognised has nothing here to move, which is the
// same gate the screen tier sits behind.

// agentVerdict is what one tier read on a pane: a state, the message to report
// with it, the kind of block the matching rule names, and the source to report
// it as. ok is false when no rule matched. kind is carried into
// AgentReport.Kind, which is what blocked_by reports for needs_input.

// louder. Every idle reading then goes through the confirmation gate in
// agent_idle.go before it is published.
//
// A blocking reading on the screen also silences a working title. The prompt
// is the fact a user needs, and a spinner frame left in the title would
// otherwise take the pane back to working on every look, ahead of the screen
// reading that is trying to override that claim.
//
