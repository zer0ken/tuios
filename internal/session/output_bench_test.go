// unconditional here far more expensive than its source line suggests.

// bytes are: recording the chunk in the catch-up ring, and handing it to every
// subscriber. The PTY read and the VT parse are deliberately outside: the read
// is a syscall the benchmark cannot honestly reproduce, and the parse is
// already covered by the emulator benchmarks in internal/vt.
