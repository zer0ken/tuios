// daemon syncs it to attached clients alongside the rest of the window state.

// The zero value is AgentStateNone, which is also what a pane not running an
// agent reports. Storing none as the empty string keeps it out of serialized
// state entirely (omitempty), so older on-disk state and older clients that never
// heard of agent state read back as none, which is exactly the pre-existing
