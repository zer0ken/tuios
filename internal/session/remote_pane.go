// A pane in this daemon's session whose process runs on another machine: the
// near half of a global session. The far half is hostedPane in
// hosted_pane.go, and the case for the split is written there.
//
// This is a paneIO and nothing more. PTY takes it in place of the pty it would
// have spawned, and from that line upward nothing changes: the same emulator
// parses the bytes, the same scrollback keeps them, the same ring buffer
// sequences them and the same subscribers receive them. A window holding one
// of these is an ordinary window of an ordinary session, which is what makes a
// global session ordinary everywhere else in the daemon.
//
// The four methods map onto two channels, and which one carries what is forced
// by the shape of the far side. Read, Write and Close are the pane's own
// connection, raw from the open reply onward. Resize cannot be: the connection
// is carrying the process's bytes and framing them to make room for a control
// message would mean inventing a protocol on top of a pty. So a resize goes
// out as a verb on the link's control stream instead, addressed by the pane id
// the open returned.

// remotePaneOpenBudget bounds the open. It covers dialing a stream on a link
// that is already up and the far daemon spawning a process, both of which are
// fast or broken.
