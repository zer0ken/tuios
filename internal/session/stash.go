// This file holds the session stash: a daemon-owned file store an agent can put
// bytes into and then attach by path, with the session's lifetime rather than
// the producer's.
//
// It exists because the mailbox's attachments are sender-owned paths. That is
// the right default and it stays the fast path: the ring never copies, so a
// megabyte image costs the ring nothing. What it does not answer is who owns the
// file. The sender's temp file can vanish between the send and the read, which
// the reader learns as MISSING, and every agent invents its own /tmp convention
// to avoid it. The stash is the other half of the same split A2A's FilePart
// makes: bytes when the producer will not keep them, a uri when it will. The
// bytes still never enter the ring; they go on disk beside the socket, and the
// message carries the path as before.
//
// The one promise is lifetime. A stashed file lives as long as the session and
// no longer. That is what makes it safe to hand another agent a path and stop
// thinking about it, and it is why the store never falls back to a directory
// that outlives a boot: a stash that quietly became permanent would be a disk
// leak with a friendly name, which is exactly what this replaces.

// Caps. Same reasoning as the ring's: a store with no bound is a disk leak.
