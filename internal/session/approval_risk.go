// Risky approvals and plans: the daemon's half.
//
// The risk rules (internal/risk) mark an approval whose command matched one
// as risky. The mark is the daemon's, computed here and carried on the Inbox
// item, and so is the rule that follows from it: an allow of a risky call is
// only taken with risk_ack naming exactly the rules it matched. The Inbox
// sends that on the second press of the same key, so an allow is two
// deliberate presses; an older client sends none and cannot allow a risky call
// at all, which leaves it to the pane. That is fail closed.
//
// The rules run in two places:
//
//   - at request-approval, on the call the hook names (tool and target), else
//     on its line, for the hold;
//   - on every needs_input report of kind approval, on the line the pane
//     reported, for an approval nobody holds. tuios's own hooks report
//     "approve <Tool>: <what>", which is read as that tool and argument; any
//     other line is read as a command. The line is clipped, so a clipped one
//     is also marked cut short.
//
// respond, the peek's key presses, takes risk_ack under the same rule for its
// approving actions, and refuses them from a pane with the respond grant
// unless [agents.approvals.risk] panes_may_allow is set. A deny is always one
// press and never refused.
//
// A plan is held with its text, which get-approval serves while the hold runs.
// Its digest, plan_sha, is on the item, and an allow of a plan must name it:
// an answer made from one plan cannot approve another.

// Bounds on what request-approval takes.
