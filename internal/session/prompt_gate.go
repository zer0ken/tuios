// The stall gate: did the agent take the prompt it was just given?
//
// submitPrompt pastes a prompt and presses Enter, and what it cannot know is
// whether the application read that Enter as "submit". A TUI still starting
// drops keys, a TUI that detects a paste by timing turns an Enter inside the
// burst into a newline, and a TUI with a different submit key leaves the text in
// its input box. In every one of those cases the prompt sits there unsent, and
// until now ask-agent waited out its settle time and returned an empty reply as
// if the agent had nothing to say, and fan reported the prompt as sent.
//
// So after the Enter the pane has a few seconds to show that it took the
// prompt, which is what herdr calls the agent_prompt_stalled check:
//
//   - its agent state turns working, or needs_input when it was not on
//     needs_input before, or done;
//   - it finishes a turn, which CompletionSeq counts, for an agent quick enough
//     to go working and back to rest between two looks;
//   - or it prints something after the Enter, but only for a pane whose harness
//     has no rule that shows working. For a harness that can show working,
//     output alone is not evidence: a TUI that read the Enter as a newline also
//     redraws its input box, and that is exactly the stall this gate is for.
//
// A pane that shows none of these in time is reported as stalled: ask-agent
// fails with prompt_stalled, and fan records prompt_status stalled. Nothing is
// typed again, because the prompt may still be sitting in the input box and a
// second copy would be worse than the first being late.
