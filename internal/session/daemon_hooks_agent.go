// fireAgentStateHook applies the [notifications.agent] policy to a transition
// and fires the hook the policy leaves standing.
//
// The policy is the client's, read from the same config table, so a user who
// muted a state stays muted whichever side runs the command. Two of its rules
// are deliberately not applied the same way:
//
//   - suppress_focused asks not to be told about a pane the user is looking at.
//     With no client attached nobody is looking at anything, so it applies only
//     while a client is attached, and only while at least one attached
//     client's terminal has not reported losing focus.
//   - The dock message, the bell and the sound cue stay in the client. They
//     need a terminal and a person. Only the command moves.
//
// Everything after the two pure checks runs off this goroutine, because reading
// the client table or the session back from the sink would take a second lock
// under the state lock the sink already holds.
