// A hosted pane that outlives a dropped link.
//
// A pane this machine runs for another machine used to end the moment its
// connection did, and a connection over ssh drops whenever the network under
// it does: a laptop lid, a Wi-Fi hand-off, a VPN reconnecting. An agent in the
// pane died mid-turn each time.
//
// Now the owner asks for a resumable pane (open-pane's resumable), and this
// machine grants the grace its link policy names for the owner (hosted_grace,
// ten minutes by default, "0" for none). The process's output goes through a
// pump that outlives any one connection: it keeps the last 64 KB in a ring
// with a running byte count and writes each chunk to the connection attached
// now, if there is one. When the connection drops, the pane waits, still
// running and still read, for the grace. The owner reattaches with open-pane's
// resume, naming the pane, the resume token and how many bytes it received;
// the pump replays what was missed from the ring, or the whole ring with gap
// set when more was missed than it holds, and goes on from there.
//
// What is enforced:
//
//   - A reattach needs the resume token, which is in the open-pane reply only,
//     compared in constant time. A pane with no grace has no token and cannot
//     be reattached.
//   - The grace is this machine's decision, from its own policy for the owner,
//     never the owner's; the owner only asks for one. At most 24 hours.
//   - A pane nobody reattaches ends when its grace runs out, and the daemon
//     logs it. A pane whose process exits while detached ends at once.
//   - close-pane ends a pane at once. The owner sends it when the window is
//     closed on purpose, so a deliberate close does not leave a process
//     waiting out its grace.
//   - The pump never blocks on a detached pane: output is kept in the ring
//     and the oldest is dropped, so a process that writes while nobody
//     listens keeps running rather than stalling on a full pty.

// hostedRingSize is how much of a hosted pane's output is kept for a reattach.
// It matches the ring a daemon keeps per pane for a resubscribing client.
