// Desktop notifications from a pane, read as agent state.
//
// A harness that wants its user sends a desktop notification over OSC 9, OSC
// 777 or OSC 99. Both emulators parsed those and the daemon threw them away:
// only an attached client ever saw one, as a toast, so a harness asking for
// approval in a session nobody was attached to asked nobody. Now the daemon
// reads them too. Every one is published on the event stream as a
// notification event, and one from a pane attributed to a harness is matched
// against that harness's [notify] rules and, when a rule matches, becomes the
// pane's agent state. The state change is what raises the rail, the alert and
// the after-agent-state hook, the same way any other source's would.
//
// A notification is filed under the OSC source, beside the title and the
// progress sequence: it is an escape sequence the program sent about itself.
// It is also an event rather than a standing fact, so its claim goes stale the
// moment the pane paints anything after it (see AgentReport.event).

// paneNotification is one parked notification.

	title string

// Called from the VT callback under the terminal lock, so it is one atomic
// store. A burst between two output events collapses to the newest.
