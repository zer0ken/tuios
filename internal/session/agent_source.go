// AgentSource names where a window's agent state came from, and is the key its
// precedence is decided on. More than one source can want to set the same pane:
// the harness reporting for itself, an escape sequence it emitted, a rule
// matched against its screen, and the silence timer can all have an opinion at
// once. A bool could only record whether the foreground-process detector had
// claimed the window, which is why it was replaced by this.
//
// The rule is one line: a source may write over a claim ranked at or below its
// own, and never over one ranked above it. A source updating its own claim is
// the same-rank case and is always allowed, so a harness can move a pane from
// working to needs_input without having to relinquish anything first.
//
// There is exactly one exception, and it is about staleness rather than about
// the ranking being wrong: a screen rule that can see a blocking prompt on the
// pane right now may write over a higher-ranked claim that has gone quiet while
// the pane painted over it. See blockerOverridesClaim for the conditions and
// releaseAgentBlockerOverride for how it is given back.
