// This file is the one way the daemon types a prompt into an agent's pane and
// submits it. ask-agent and the fan prompt both go through it, so the two
// cannot disagree about what a submitted prompt looks like.
//
// Both used to write the text and a line feed. That is wrong in two ways for
// the TUIs agents run in. Claude Code and Codex submit on carriage return, which
// is what the Enter key sends, and several agent TUIs bind a line feed (Ctrl+J)
// to "insert a newline", so a prompt could sit in the input box unsent. And a
// multi-line prompt typed as raw lines is a sequence of Enters, so an agent that
// does submit on a line feed sent the first line alone.
//
// So the prompt is pasted and then submitted, the way a person pastes and
// presses Enter:
//
//  1. The text, with its trailing line breaks dropped. When the pane has
//     bracketed paste on (DECSET 2004), it is wrapped in ESC[200~ and ESC[201~,
//     so the application reads it as one paste whatever lines it holds.
//  2. A short wait, so the application has taken the paste in before the key
//     that submits it arrives. TUIs that detect a paste by timing (Codex does)
//     turn an Enter that arrives inside the burst into a newline.
//  3. The submit key: a carriage return, unless the harness's manifest says
//     it submits on a line feed.
//
// The harness's [input] block can change three things, and only these: the
// submit key, whether a bracketed paste is allowed at all (a harness that
// turns DECSET 2004 on and mishandles a paste can refuse it), and whether a
// focus-in report (CSI I) goes first, for a harness that ignores a submit while
// it believes it is unfocused. The focus report is only sent when the pane has
// focus reporting (DECSET 1004) on, so an application that never asked for
// focus events never sees the bytes. See harness.Input.

// Bracketed paste delimiters, DECSET 2004.

// application has DECSET 1004 on.

// return. herdr waits this long unconditionally; see promptSubmitQuiet for when
// the wait ends sooner.

// promptSubmitQuiet is how long the pane must stay silent, after printing
// something in answer to the paste, for the paste to count as taken in. An
// application that echoes the paste and then goes quiet has drawn it, and the
// full wait would only slow the ask down. One that prints nothing gets the whole
// promptSubmitMaxWait, since silence then says nothing about whether it has
// read the paste yet.
