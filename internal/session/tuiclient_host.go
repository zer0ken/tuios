// A TUI client attached to a session on another machine.
//
// The client dials its own daemon, asks it for a connection to the host, and
// then runs the ordinary binary attach protocol on that connection with the
// host's daemon: hello, attach, PTY streams, keystrokes. Every byte of the
// session's output is decoded by this process's own emulator and drawn by this
// process's own renderer, with this machine's theme, config and prefix key.
// Nothing about the far side is rendered as anything but a session.
//
// The one thing that differs from a local attach is trust. A daemon on another
// machine is another machine's process, possibly older, possibly newer,
// possibly compromised. Its output goes into an emulator, which is the same
// fence a shell's output gets. Its state pushes describe its own session and
// nothing else. The one message a daemon sends that can make a client do
// something on its own machine is a routed command, and that is where the
// fence below is.

// ConnectThroughHost connects to the daemon on host by way of the daemon on
// this machine, and performs the handshake with it.
//
// The local daemon opens a stream on its link to the host and relays; see
// open-host-connection. From the handshake on, the client is an ordinary
// client of the remote daemon, and its errors say which machine they are
// about.
