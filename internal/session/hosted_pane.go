// A pane this machine runs on another machine's behalf: the far half of a
// global session.
//
// A global session is not a new kind of session. It is an ordinary session
// that happens to hold a window whose process runs somewhere else, which is
// what keeps `tuios ls`, the verbs, the mailbox, hooks and rehydration working
// on it with no special case. The near half is remotePane in remote_pane.go.
//
// The division of labour is the whole design, and it is deliberately lopsided.
// This machine supplies a process and a pty and nothing else: it runs no
// emulator for the pane, keeps no scrollback for it, and does not know which
// session or window it belongs to. The daemon that asked owns all of that, the
// same way it does for a pane of its own, because a hosted pane reaches it
// through PTY's paneIO seam and every path above that seam is already
// indifferent to where the bytes came from.
//
// That is why there is exactly one emulator per pane rather than two. The
// alternative, attaching a session here and borrowing a window from it, would
// have run a second emulator over the same bytes and, worse, enrolled the pane
// in this machine's size negotiation: a session's size is the minimum over its
// attached clients, so a pane sized by a layout on another machine would have
// shrunk the session of anyone working here directly. A hosted pane has one
// reader and one writer and takes its size from them alone.
//
// This grants no authority that the link did not already carry. A host in the
// [hosts] table can already be asked to attach or create a session, and a
// session is a shell. Spawning a process here is the same permission stated
// more directly, and it is refused on the same link that refuses everything
// else.
