// BenchmarkAgentDetectScanLockWait measures what the detection poll costs the
// rest of a session: how long a writer that wants the session's state lock
// waits while scans run, over real panes running real shells.
//
// The scan reads the foreground process of every pane, which on darwin is three
// sysctls a pane and on Linux a few procfs reads. It used to do those reads
// while holding the state write lock, so every writer in the session (a state
// sync from a client, a set-agent-state, a window closing) queued behind them
// every two seconds. The scan now reads with no lock held and takes the write
// lock only to apply a change, so an idle session's writers never wait on it.
//
// Reported per scan: ns/op is the whole scan, max-wait-us is the longest wait a
// writer polling the lock saw while the scans ran, which is about one scan's
// hold of the write lock, and mean-wait-us is its average over every poll. Every pane is
// scanned on every op (applyAgentDetection has no backoff), so the numbers
// compare full scans before and after. Measured figures are in docs/perf.md.
