// Approvals answered from the Inbox.
//
// A harness with a structured decision channel, Claude Code's PermissionRequest
// hook or opencode's permission reply, can be told the answer to its permission
// prompt by the hook instead of asking in its pane. With [agents.approvals]
// naming the harness, `tuios agent-hook` does that: after reporting the pane as
// needs_input it calls request-approval, and the call does not answer until the
// person answers the Inbox item with reply-approval, or the hold ends. The hook
// then prints the harness's own decision, or nothing, and a harness that gets
// nothing shows its own prompt as it always did. That fallback is the whole
// safety story, so every way a hold can end without an answer ends it with no
// decision:
//
//   - the hold times out ([agents.approvals] hold_seconds, 120 by default);
//   - the pane leaves needs_input, closes, or its block turns into a question;
//   - the person dismisses the item, presses enter on it, or focuses the pane;
//   - the hook goes away, which is how a harness that gave up on it shows;
//   - a second request for the same pane arrives;
//   - the daemon shuts down.
//
// Who may do what:
//
//   - Only reply-approval can put a decision in a hold, and it takes the same
//     proof dismiss-attention does: the nonce of a client attached right now,
//     from a process that is not inside a pane of this daemon (human_sender.go
//     and human_origin.go). An agent cannot answer its own prompt or another
//     agent's, and no mail, ask or send-keys reaches a hold.
//   - request-approval is refused over a link, and a caller inside a pane may
//     only hold the prompt of the pane it runs in. All it gets back is what the
//     person answered about the item it opened, which says nothing it did not
//     ask.
//   - A hold is only opened on a pane already on needs_input with kind
//     approval, which the hook's own report establishes, so a stray call
//     cannot put an approval in the Inbox for a pane that is not blocked.
//
// The holds live in the attention store under its lock, beside the items they
// belong to, so an item and its hold cannot disagree: closing the item ends the
// hold, and ending the hold clears the item's request.
