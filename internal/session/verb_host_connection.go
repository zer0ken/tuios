// open-host-connection: a connection to the daemon on another machine.
//
// This is the one primitive under everything that is not a listing. A client
// that wants to attach a session on host "build", or run a verb there, asks
// this daemon for a connection to build's daemon and then speaks build's
// daemon's own protocol on it, binary or JSON, exactly as it would on build's
// socket. The daemon in the middle relays bytes and reads none of them.
//
// That shape is chosen over forwarding verbs one by one for three reasons.
// Attaching is a stream and not a request, so a per-verb forwarder would have
// to grow a second channel for it anyway. The remote daemon's own protocol
// already carries version negotiation and its own errors, so nothing here has
// to know which verbs the far side has. And the untrusted fence stays where it
// already is: in the one process that decodes the far side's bytes, which is
// the client that asked, never this daemon.
//
// What this daemon does guarantee: the far side gets no channel into this
// daemon (the link refuses inbound streams), a stream nobody drains is dropped
// without costing the link, and a frame is never larger than the link's cap.

// verbOpenHostConnection opens the connection and hands the client's
// connection to the relay once the reply has been written.
