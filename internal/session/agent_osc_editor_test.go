// TestEditorProgressThenBrewLeavesAPlainPane is the regression test for a shell
// pane listed as an agent after `nvim Brewfile` and then `brew bundle`. Neovim
// sent its OSC 9;4 progress pair, which moved the pane from no state to working
// and then idle, attributed to no harness. Nothing cleared it afterwards: the
// pane sat at its prompt listed as an idle agent with source osc, through the
// whole brew run and after it. The brew output itself was never the trigger,
// and it is replayed here to show it stays inert.
//
// The bytes go through the emulator and are applied the way the daemon's output
// handler applies them, and a detection tick then sees the pane back at its
// shell. A pane attributed to a harness gets the same bytes as the positive
// control: there the sequence still drives state.
