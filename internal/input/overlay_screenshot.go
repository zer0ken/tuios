// The screenshot chord over an open overlay.
//
// An overlay owns the keyboard while it is up, and several of them own the
// leader with it: the review in either mode, and in terminal mode every panel
// that is checked ahead of the leader. So the leader and the key after it went
// to the overlay, and the one screen a person wanted to capture could not be.
//
// The fix holds a leader pressed over an overlay for exactly one key. When that
// key is the screenshot key, capture mode opens over the overlay, which stays
// open and is part of what is captured. Any other key is not the chord, so the
// held leader and then the key are routed exactly as they would have been, one
// after the other. An overlay therefore sees the same keys in the same order
// as before; the leader only reaches it one key later.
//
// Copy mode and the scrollback browser are left out (see OS.OverlayOnScreen).
// They are reading views over a pane, not panels, and both page up on ctrl+b,
// the default leader, which has to happen when it is pressed rather than one
// key later.

// isScreenshotKey reports whether msg is bound to the screenshot action in the
// prefix section, the key that follows the leader in the chord.

// routeOverlayScreenshot runs the screenshot chord over an open overlay. It
// reports whether it answered the key; when it did not, the caller routes the
// key as usual.
