// Package edition says which build of tuios this binary is: the full tuios,
// or tuios-slim, which is cmd/tuios built with the slim build tag.
//
// tuios-slim keeps the multiplexer and leaves out the features listed in
// docs/SLIM.md. Each left-out feature lives in files tagged !slim, and its
// slim counterpart is a small stub in a *_slim.go file. This package holds
// the one sentence every stub prints, so the wording is the same everywhere.
//
// Code should not branch on Slim. A feature that differs between the builds
// gets a pair of files instead; Slim is for the version report and for the
// handshake that tells a peer which build it talks to.
