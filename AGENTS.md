# AGENTS.md: Agent Guide for TUIOS

This file is for an agent **working on the TUIOS codebase**: how it is laid out,
how to build it, and the conventions to follow when changing it.

An agent **running inside a TUIOS pane** wants the other document. Run
`tuios --skill` for the core that drives a running session: addressing panes,
reading and writing them, running work and waiting on it, reporting agent
state, and talking to other agents safely. `tuios --skill TOPIC` prints the
rest (panes and state in depth, fleets, the Inbox, mail, hosts, events, MCP,
the tmux shim, grants, config, errors, recipes). The source is [skills/tuios/SKILL.md](skills/tuios/SKILL.md)
and the other files in `skills/tuios/`, embedded in the binary so the printed
copy always matches the build. `cmd/tuios` tests resolve every command the
skill shows against the command tree.

## Project Overview

TUIOS (Terminal UI Operating System) is a terminal-based window manager built in Go using the Charm stack (Bubble Tea v2, Lipgloss v2). It provides vim-like modal interface, workspace support, mouse interaction, and SSH server mode.

**Note:** The web terminal functionality is provided by the separate `tuios-web` binary for security isolation. See `cmd/tuios-web/` and [docs/WEB.md](docs/WEB.md) for details.

## Essential Commands

### Build & Run

```bash
# Build from source
go build -o tuios ./cmd/tuios
go build -o tuios-web ./cmd/tuios-web
go build -tags slim -o tuios-slim ./cmd/tuios   # tuios-slim, see docs/SLIM.md

# Run directly
go run ./cmd/tuios
go run ./cmd/tuios-web

# Run with debug logging
go run ./cmd/tuios --debug
go run ./cmd/tuios-web --debug

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Leave the machine usable. The maintainer works on this box while the suite
# runs, and an uncapped build or test run takes every core. taskset confines the
# whole process tree to half the cores, and the affinity is inherited, so it
# also holds for the daemons and shells the e2e suite spawns. GOMAXPROCS and
# `go test -p` do not, because they only bind the Go runtime.
nice -n 10 taskset -c 0-7 go test ./... -timeout 20m

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/config/...
go test ./internal/tape/...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run the tests of the ghostty backend. `go build -tags ghostty ./...` compiles
# it and runs none of its tests, so a change that passes the plain suite can
# still be wrong on the backend `scripts/install.sh ghostty` builds. The
# ghostty-vt workflow runs every package whose tests link internal/vt; these
# are the ones that matter most, the renderer in internal/app included.
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/.ghostty-vt/native/pkgconfig" \
  go test -tags ghostty -count=1 -short \
    ./internal/vt/ ./internal/session/ ./internal/terminal/ \
    ./internal/app/ ./internal/input/ ./cmd/tuios/
```

### Browser build (Learn tuios)

`cmd/tuios-wasm` is tuios compiled to WebAssembly for the guided tour at
tuios.dev/learn: the real app in Learn mode, with a fake shell
(`internal/webshell`) in every pane and an event stream for lessons
(`internal/learn`). Browser-only code is behind `js` build tags or in those
three directories, so the native build is unchanged. The page API and event
contract are in [cmd/tuios-wasm/README.md](cmd/tuios-wasm/README.md).

```bash
cmd/tuios-wasm/build.sh out/                  # the files the docs site needs
node cmd/tuios-wasm/serve.mjs out/ 8765       # try it at http://127.0.0.1:8765
go test ./internal/webshell/ ./internal/learn/  # native tests of the Go side
```

A change to `internal/app` or `internal/input` can break the js build without
breaking any native one. The learn-web workflow builds it on every pull
request.

### Development with Nix

```bash
nix develop    # Enter development shell
nix build      # Build package
nix run        # Run directly
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t tuios .
docker run -it --rm tuios
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Bubble Tea MVU Pattern

TUIOS follows Model-View-Update:
- **Model**: `app.OS` struct in `internal/app/os.go`
- **View**: `OS.View()` in `internal/app/render.go`
- **Update**: `OS.Update()` in `internal/app/update.go`

### Modal Input System

Two primary modes:
1. **WindowManagementMode**: Window manipulation, navigation
2. **TerminalMode**: Input forwarded to focused terminal PTY

Input routing: `internal/input/handler.go` → mode-specific handlers

### Prefix Key System (tmux-style)

Leader key (`Ctrl+B` by default) activates prefix mode with sub-menus:
- `Ctrl+B` then `w` → Workspace prefix
- `Ctrl+B` then `m` → Minimize prefix
- `Ctrl+B` then `t` → Window prefix
- `Ctrl+B` then `L` → Layout prefix
- `Ctrl+B` then `D` → Debug prefix
- `Ctrl+B` then `T` → Tape manager prefix

Tiling itself toggles on `Ctrl+B` `Space` (or bare `t` in window-management mode).

### Window Lifecycle

1. `OS.AddWindow()` creates window with PTY
2. PTY spawns shell process with I/O polling goroutines
3. VT emulator parses ANSI output
4. Screen buffer updates trigger render
5. `OS.DeleteWindow()` cleans up PTY and removes window

## Key Dependencies

- **Bubble Tea v2** (`charm.land/bubbletea/v2`): TUI framework
- **Lipgloss v2** (`charm.land/lipgloss/v2`): Styling
- **Wish v2** (`charm.land/wish/v2`): SSH server
- **Ultraviolet** (`github.com/charmbracelet/ultraviolet`): Terminal emulation base
- **Cobra** (`github.com/spf13/cobra`): CLI commands
- **xpty** (`github.com/charmbracelet/x/xpty`): Cross-platform PTY
- **libghostty-vt** (`go.mitchellh.com/libghostty`, behind `-tags ghostty`): Alternative VT emulation backend; `scripts/install.sh ghostty` builds it (see `docs/ghostty-vt.md`)
- **sip** (`github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/sip`): WebGL terminal serving for `tuios-web`

> **Note:** As of December 2025, the Charm stack packages have migrated from `github.com/charmbracelet/*` to `charm.land/*` module paths.

## Coding Conventions

### Go Style

- Follow standard Go conventions ([Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go))
- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Package comments on all packages (see existing `internal/*/` packages)
- Meaningful variable names (avoid single letters except loop indices)

### Colours in Render Code

- Take every chrome colour from `theme.UI()` (dialogs) or `theme.GroundUI()`
  (the rail and the dock), both an `overlay.Palette`, or from a named token in
  `internal/theme`. Never write a literal: `internal/lint` rejects
  `lipgloss.Color("#...")`, constant `color.RGBA{...}`, `charmtone.*` and
  constant `ansi.BasicColor`/`IndexedColor` in `internal/app` and
  `internal/overlay`. A deliberate exception carries `//tuios:allow-color <reason>`.
- The palette is built per colour depth (`overlay.Depth`: truecolor, 256, 16).
  At 16 colours every ground is `overlay.NoColor`, so a state that a ground
  would show has to go through `pal.Row` or `pal.Mark`.
- Lists follow one rule: `overlay.RowState{Cursor, Focused, Hover}`, the row's
  ground from `pal.Ground(st, base)`, and the finished row through
  `pal.Row(content, width, st, base)`. An unfocused list keeps its cursor.
- Blend with `overlay.MixColors` (OKLab); measure with `overlay.Readable` and
  `ReadableAt`, which measure the colour the depth will actually show.

### Error Handling

- Wrap errors with context: `fmt.Errorf("failed to X: %w", err)`
- Log warnings for non-fatal issues: `log.Printf("Warning: ...")`
- Return early on errors

### Documentation

- Package-level doc comments required
- Exported types/functions need doc comments
- Use godoc-style comments

### Testing

Follow the Testing rules under Testing Approach. For the unit tests that stay:

- Test file naming: `*_test.go`
- Benchmarks with `Benchmark*` prefix, and only for a perf budget
- Use `t.Run()` for subtests

## Testing Approach

### Testing rules

- Never write unit tests after you write code.
- Highly prefer E2E tests as the sole testing mechanism. Use them to verify complex features work. At the end of E2E tests, produce a verifiable and repeatable artifact.
- If you must test a system in isolation, first write down all the ways it could fail, then write the code.

A unit test is kept only when it catches a real bug the E2E suite misses. The
kinds that stay are VT conformance, fuzz, wire compatibility, security
boundaries, deterministic race regressions and perf budgets. Do not add one
outside those kinds.

### E2E Tests

The E2E suite runs a real `tuios` binary against real daemons. It is under
`e2e/tui`, its own Go module, and skips unless `TUIOS_E2E` is set. Without
`TUIOS_E2E_BIN` it builds the binary itself.

```bash
go build -o /tmp/tuios ./cmd/tuios
cd e2e/tui && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios go test -count=1 -timeout 40m .
```

A test that claims to cover a bug must fail on a build with the fix removed.
`e2e/tui/NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md` records those runs and the rules for them.

### Kept Unit Tests

```bash
# Everything outside e2e/tui
go test ./...

# One package
go test ./internal/vt/

# Perf budgets
go test -bench=. ./internal/app/...
```

### Terminal Emulator Conformance

`internal/vt/` carries a table-driven conformance corpus: an input byte
sequence, and the screen it should produce, on a screen small enough that a
diff is readable. It runs with the ordinary suite.

```bash
# The corpus, the unicode sweeps and the generated-input sweep
go test ./internal/vt/

# Skips the exhaustive write-boundary sweep, which is the slow part
go test -short ./internal/vt/
```

Three things in it are worth knowing about before adding a case:

- A case that leaves `unhandled` false asserts the emulator recognised every
  sequence in its input. A sequence the emulator ignores leaves a screen
  indistinguishable from one it handled by doing nothing, which is how NEL and
  DECALN stayed missing under green tests.
- A case marked `knownBug` is expected to fail, and the test complains if it
  starts passing, so a fixed bug cannot sit on the list pretending to still be
  one.
- The unicode sweeps are driven by pinned UCD data files under
  `internal/vt/testdata/unicode/`, with provenance and licence in the README
  there.

### Terminal Emulator Fuzzing

`internal/fuzz/vtgen` generates terminal input by grammar rather than by byte,
so the parser reaches the code past its ground state. A failing run reduces by
delta debugging to a script of named sequences a person can read.

```bash
# Deterministic seeds, part of the ordinary suite
go test ./internal/vt/ -run TestVTGen

# Coverage-guided, for a real campaign
go test ./internal/vt/ -run XXX -fuzz FuzzEmulatorScript -fuzztime 10m
```

### Fuzzing

Every `Fuzz*` target's seeds, and every file under a package's
`testdata/fuzz/`, run in the ordinary suite. The mutator runs only when asked,
and nightly in `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`, which keeps each package's corpus
in the Actions cache and uploads the failing input when a target finds
something. `go test -list 'Fuzz' ./...` lists the targets. Besides the
emulator ones above:

- `internal/app`: `FuzzModel` drives the whole window manager through the
  `internal/fuzz` action alphabet; the clip and line-width targets check the
  compositor against `ansi.StringWidth`.
- `internal/session`: the frame reader, the gob payloads (decode, bound,
  round trip), the JSON verb dispatcher, and selectors.
- `internal/harness`: `Classify` against `Explain` over the bundled
  manifests and over fuzzed ones.
- `internal/config` and `internal/tape`: key normalisation, the config
  pipeline, and the tape lexer and parser.
- `internal/vt`: the kitty payload decoder and command parser, and with
  `-tags ghostty` the differential against libghostty-vt.

Turn a finding into a regression the suite can keep:

- A vtgen target prints the reduced script as JSON. Save it under
  `internal/vt/testdata/vtgen-repros/` with a `why`. Do not keep the input
  bytes instead: they decode through the generator, and the next change to
  vtgen turns them into a different script that passes.
- `FuzzModel` and the other `internal/fuzz` runs print a `--- script ---`
  block. Save it under `internal/app/testdata/fuzz-repros/`.
- Any other target: keep the file `go test` wrote under `testdata/fuzz/`.

A repro printed with `NOT REPRODUCIBLE` came from a target whose replays
differ; fix the target before trusting the script.

### Differential Testing Against tmux

An independent implementation catches what a hand-written expectation cannot,
because a test can be wrong in the same way the code is. Needs the `tmux` binary
and spawns processes, so it is behind a build tag.

```bash
go test -tags differential ./internal/vt/ -run TestDifferential -v
```

Cases where tmux is the one diverging are listed in `tmuxDiffers` with the
reasoning. The test fails if one of them starts agreeing, so the list cannot
rot.

### Manual Testing Checklist

When testing UI/UX changes:
- [ ] Create/close multiple windows
- [ ] Switch between workspaces (Alt+1-9)
- [ ] Test tiling mode (t key)
- [ ] Test copy mode (Ctrl+B, [)
- [ ] Verify keybindings work
- [ ] Check terminal output rendering
- [ ] Test mouse interactions (drag, resize)

### Tape Script Testing

```bash
# Validate tape syntax
go run ./cmd/tuios tape validate examples/demo.tape

# Run tape with visible TUI
go run ./cmd/tuios tape play examples/demo.tape
```

## Common Gotchas

### Bubble Tea v2 Specifics

- Use `tea.KeyPressMsg` not `tea.KeyMsg` (v2 change)
- Mouse events are separate types: `tea.MouseClickMsg`, `tea.MouseMotionMsg`, etc.
- `tea.WithFilter()` for event filtering (used for mouse motion filtering)

### VT Emulator

- Theme colors only apply to ANSI colors 0-15
- RGB/truecolor passes through unchanged
- Background is transparent (nil) for TUI app compatibility. `appearance.background` and
  the per-surface background options paint default-background cells in the compositor
  (`internal/app/background.go`), never in the emulator, so the cells themselves stay nil

### Performance Considerations

- Style cache in `internal/app/stylecache.go`: check hit rates with `Ctrl+B, D, c`
- Object pools in `internal/pool/pool.go` reduce GC pressure
- Viewport culling skips off-screen windows
- Rendering is event-driven: idle sessions schedule no timer renders (see `docs/perf.md` for the measured baselines)

### Platform Differences

- PTY handling differs: `internal/terminal/window_unix.go` vs `window_windows.go`,
  and `internal/ptyspawn/spawn_unix.go` vs `spawn_windows.go`. The daemon's
  `PTY` in `internal/session/session.go` has no per-platform file: it resizes
  through `ptyspawn.SetWinsize`, which falls back to a plain resize on ConPTY.
  The daemon's platform split is in `internal/session/daemon_unix.go` vs
  `daemon_windows.go` and `manager_unix.go` vs `manager_windows.go`
- Workspace keybinds differ: `opt+N` on macOS, `alt+N` on Linux
- See `internal/config/userconfig.go` → `getDefaultWorkspaceKeybinds()`

### Keybind Registry

- Leader key configurable but defaults to `ctrl+b`
- Check action descriptions in `internal/config/registry.go`
- Key normalization handles `opt+` → `alt+` conversion on macOS
