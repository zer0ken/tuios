// Package tuie2e drives a real tuios binary inside a real pseudo-terminal and
// asserts on what a user would actually see on screen.
//
// # Why this is a separate, nested Go module
//
// The harness (github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/tuitest) is a test-only dependency that
// spawns PTYs and vendors a VT emulator. tuitest is public, so requiring it
// would work, but it would land in the dependency graph of everyone who imports
// tuios, for code that only ever runs under `go test`. A nested module keeps the
// tests versioned alongside the code they guard while leaving the main module's
// go.mod and go.sum untouched.
//
// It is nested under e2e/ rather than placed beside it because e2e/ already
// holds the build-tagged control-plane suite, which belongs to the main module.
// A nested module is invisible to the parent, so `go test -tags e2e ./e2e/...`
// at the repo root still runs exactly what it ran before and does not descend
// here.
//
// # Running
//
//	cd e2e/tui && TUIOS_E2E=1 go test -count=1 ./...
//
// Without TUIOS_E2E the whole package skips, because every test here forks a
// full multiplexer plus its shell children. TestMain builds the binary under
// test once into a temporary directory; set TUIOS_E2E_BIN to point the same
// assertions at a prebuilt binary, which is how the negative controls described
// in NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md are run.
//
// # Always pass -count=1
//
// This is not a style preference. Go caches test results, and a cached result
// survives a change of TUIOS_E2E_BIN, so re-running the suite against a
// deliberately broken binary can replay the previous PASS and report that a
// regression test caught nothing when in fact it was never executed. That
// happened while writing this suite and briefly made a genuine negative control
// look like a false one. Every documented command here passes -count=1, and any
// new verification run must too.
//
// # -race is not useful here
//
// The race detector instruments the test process, and the code under test runs
// in a separate tuios process, so -race on this package costs time and detects
// nothing. Race coverage for tuios's own internals belongs in the main module's
// unit tests, which is where the emulator-resize race is pinned.
//
// # Isolation
//
// Every tuios instance gets a private set of XDG directories under the test's
// own TempDir, so the daemon socket, session state, and config file never touch
// the developer's real ~/.config, ~/.local/state, or /run/user/$UID. tuitest
// starts the child with setsid and tears down the whole process group, so the
// daemon and its panes are reaped even when a test fails.
//
// # Two harness footguns this file works around
//
//  1. WaitStable can report stability against a pre-action frame: called right
//     after sending input, its quiet window can elapse before tuios has reacted.
//     Everything here waits on expected content instead.
//
//  2. tuios boots into window-management mode, where plain characters are
//     window-manager commands rather than shell input, and for 150ms after
//     entering terminal mode it deliberately swallows unmodified single-character
//     keys. enterTerminalMode handles both. An *attached* client is the other way
//     round and boots into terminal mode; windowManagementMode is the fix.
//
//  3. tuitest's own emulator panics on a scroll region wider than the screen,
//     which takes the whole test binary with it. Three lines reproduce it:
//
//     term := tuitest.StartT(t, []string{"/bin/sh"}, tuitest.WithSize(80, 24))
//     term.Resize(80, 10)
//     term.SendKeys(`printf '\033[1;24r\033[3S'`, tuitest.Enter)
//
//     internal/vt/screen.go setVerticalMargins stores DECSTBM's bottom margin
//     without clamping it to the buffer, and ultraviolet's DeleteLineArea limits
//     the delete count against the region but then indexes b.Lines[src] without
//     limiting it against the buffer, so the next scroll up runs off the end.
//     A real terminal clamps DECSTBM to the screen.
//
//     This is not exotic. A client renders a frame for the size it last knew
//     about, the PTY shrinks, and the frame lands afterwards; tuios is entitled
//     to emit that and every real terminal tolerates it. It killed an 850 second
//     fuzz campaign and took every finding in it, because a panic in the pump
//     goroutine cannot be recovered by the test. Until tuitest clamps, a long
//     campaign has to be run in seed batches so one crash costs one batch: see
//     TUIOS_FUZZ_FIRST on TestFuzzPTY.

// Mouse input
//
// A real terminal reports a pointer gesture as a strictly paired stream: one
// press report per button-down, one motion report for each cell the pointer
// crosses while a button is held, and one release report per button-up. A
// helper that takes a shortcut here does not merely test less than it claims.
// It puts tuios into a state no user can reach, and every assertion made after
// that runs against that state.
//
// Two shortcuts this suite used to take, both fixed here:
//
//  1. clickAt sent n presses and one trailing release. tuios copies a selection
//     on release, so a triple click produced a single clipboard write where a
//     real mouse produces three releases and two writes. Anything that happens
//     on an intermediate release was structurally unobservable, which is how a
//     clipboard bug survived review of the assertions: no assertion could have
//     caught it, because the harness could not generate the input.
//
//  2. leftClick and shiftRightClick sent a press and no release at all. A left
//     press inside a pane sets OS.InteractionMode, and while that flag is set
//     tuios deliberately stops polling pane content (internal/app/os_render.go
//     returns early on it). A press with no release therefore freezes every
//     pane for the remainder of the test, so any later wait for shell output is
//     waiting on a program that has stopped reading its panes.
//     TestClickInPaneDoesNotFreezeOutput is the standing guard on that.
//
// What this cannot simulate is documented in NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md under
// "What this harness structurally cannot observe"; the short version is that
// cmd/tuios/run.go installs a whitelist filter that drops motion events unless
// a drag, a resize, an overlay drag, the scrollback browser or a mouse-tracking
// application is active, so motion sent outside those states is dropped before
// the model sees it and asserting on its effect would assert on nothing.

const (
	// mouseGap is the pause after each mouse report. Real reports arrive one at

	// inside internal/input.multiClickInterval for tuios to read the clicks as
	// one gesture: 40ms against a 300ms window.
	//
	// They are shorter than mouseGap, and deliberately so. mouseGap is spaced
	// for motion, which tuios coalesces to a frame budget; presses and releases
	// pass through untouched (cmd/tuios/run.go filters motion and nothing else),
	// and the harness was measured sending all six reports of a triple click
	// with no pause at all and having every one of them counted, 10 times out of
	// 10. So the pause between the clicks of one gesture buys no fidelity, and
	// what it costs is margin: tuios measures the interval when it processes the
	// press, not when the byte arrives, so every millisecond of nominal spacing
	// is a millisecond less stall it takes to push the third click outside the
	// window and turn the gesture into a double click plus a single one.
	//
	// Measured on this machine: with the interval widened deliberately, the
	// gesture was still read as three clicks at 295ms and never at 300ms, so
	// there is no fixed overhead to leave room for, only the stall. What is left
