		Use:   "agent-hook <harness> [event] [payload]",
		Short: "Report a harness hook event as the pane's agent state",
		Long: `Report a coding-agent harness's hook event to the tuios pane it runs in.

This is what the hooks tuios integration install writes run. The harness
hands its hook payload on stdin (or, for the Codex notify command, as the last
argument). The event comes from the payload, or from the event argument when
the payload does not name it. Supported harnesses: claude-code, codex,
copilot, cursor-agent, gemini-cli, opencode, amp, kilo, kimi, omp, pi and qwen,
which report the pane's state; and antigravity, crush, devin, droid, grok,
hermes and qoder, which report only the conversation id (set-agent-session)
and leave the state to the pane's screen rules.

The pane is found from --window, then TUIOS_PANE_ID, then the process's
controlling terminal, then its parent processes, so a harness or sandbox
that scrubs the environment is still reported for. A payload that does not
parse, an event with no mapping, a subagent's own tool calls, and an event
from a harness other than the one TUIOS_AGENT names are all reported as
nothing, never as done.

It asks the daemon which set-agent-state fields it supports and sends only
those. A conditional report (if_state) is not sent to a daemon older than the
condition, since that daemon would apply it unconditionally.

For claude-code and codex, a prompt, a tool call, its result and the end of a
turn also carry the event itself as activity (and gemini-cli's BeforeTool its
tool name), which the daemon keeps in the pane's activity ring for
'tuios agent-log' and the rail's "now" line. Only the first line of any text is
sent, with likely secrets masked. A Stop's done report says the first line of
what the agent said last.

Claude Code's SubagentStart and SubagentStop report no state. Each sends the
subagent with report-agent-activity, and the daemon counts the subagents
started and not yet stopped in the pane's subagents metadata, which the rail
shows on a pane at rest. A SessionStart sends its idle report and then a
session_start, which clears the count. A daemon without report-agent-activity
gets neither.

A report that ends a turn (done or errored) also sends what the pane's status
line feed (tuios agent-statusline) held back, with set-agent-meta for the same
pane, so the turn's last context and cost reach the rail.

It always exits 0, prints nothing a harness would read as an answer (Gemini
CLI gets an empty JSON object), and gives up after 500ms when the daemon is
slow or gone. Use --explain to see on stderr what it decided and why.

The one exception is a permission prompt the Inbox may answer. When
[agents.approvals] in the config names the harness (claude-code, opencode,
kilo or qwen), the hook for Claude Code's or Qwen Code's PermissionRequest, or
for opencode's permission.asked, waits after its report for the person to
answer the Inbox item, for up to hold_seconds (120 by default). A Claude Code plan
(ExitPlanMode) is held the same way unless hold_plans is false. It then prints
the harness's own decision. It prints nothing, and the harness asks in its pane as before,
when the wait ends without an answer, when approvals are off, when the daemon
is gone or restarts, and on any error. It never prints an approval it was not
given.`,
