		Long: `Start a prompt in several agents at once, each in a git worktree of its
own, and watch them side by side.

tuios creates <count> worktrees of the repository you are in, starts an agent
in each, and types the prompt into each agent once the agent shows it is at
its prompt. The command prints the sessions and returns. The rail shows them
under the repository. 'tuios worktree ls --group' shows which prompts were
sent.

--agent names the agent the way you would type it, arguments included:
claude, "codex --model o5", or any program. Several, separated by commas or
given as several --agent flags, are cycled across the sessions, so
--agent claude,codex,gemini with a count of 3 starts one of each. The program
is looked up on your PATH, which the command sends, and --env passes more of
your environment (--env NAME for your value, --env NAME=VALUE to set one).

--prompt, given once per session, gives each session its own prompt instead
of one for all; the count is then how many there are.

An agent that has not shown it is at its prompt after 30 seconds is marked
held, and the Inbox asks you to look at its pane: most often it shows a
first-run choice only you can answer. Its prompt is typed as soon as it is
ready.

The branches are a stem, then stem-2, stem-3 and so on. The stem is 'fan/'
and the first words of the prompt, or --name.

--grants says what every agent may do through tuios: read, write, fan,
respond, admin, or none. Without it they hold the default of
[agents.permissions]; a fan run from a pane without admin gives them that
pane's own grants.

'tuios fan compare <session>' shows the attempts side by side, with what each
changed and its last check. 'tuios fan verify <session> -- <command>' runs
one check in every attempt, and 'tuios fan diff A B' shows what two attempts
did differently.

When one result is the one you want, 'tuios fan keep <session>' removes the
others. It refuses to discard their uncommitted work unless you say so.

--host runs the fan-out on another machine from the [hosts] table. The
repository is the one the current directory is in, found there by its
origin URL, and --clone clones it there when the host has none. The agent
must be installed on that machine. The sessions show in the rail under the
host. 'tuios fan keep HOST:SESSION' keeps one there, and 'tuios worktree
pull HOST:SESSION' brings its work here.`,
		Example: `  # Three Claude Code agents on the same task
  tuios fan 3 --agent claude 'Add a retry with backoff to the HTTP client.'

  # One each of three harnesses, one with its own arguments
  tuios fan 3 --agent 'claude,codex --model o5,gemini' 'Add a retry with backoff.'

  # Two agents, each with its own prompt, and an API key from your shell
  tuios fan --agent claude --env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --prompt 'Add a retry.' --prompt 'Add a timeout.'

  # From a branch, with a stem you chose, waiting until every prompt is sent
  tuios fan 2 --agent codex --base main --name try/retry --wait 'Add a retry.'

  # Keep the second one, and stash what the others did
  tuios fan keep api-fan-add-a-retry-with-2 --stash
