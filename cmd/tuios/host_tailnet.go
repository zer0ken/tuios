Nothing here is added. The list is what 'tuios hosts add' suggests, so you do
not have to remember what a machine is called or type a MagicDNS name by hand.
A host exists because you named it.

Every machine on the tailnet is listed, offered or not, and a machine that is
not offered says why. Phones and tablets are left out because they cannot run
a tuios daemon; a machine that is offline is left out because it cannot be
dialled. Change any of that in the [tailscale] table of your config.

A host added from this list is reached over ssh like every other host. The
tailnet is how the name resolves and how the traffic is carried, and tuios
does not dial a tailnet address itself.
