// `tuios update`: replace a binary installed from a release archive with the
// newest one.
//
// The shape of this command is set by one fact. A binary the curl one-liner put
// on the machine has nothing that owns it, so nothing else can update it; every
// other way of installing tuios has an owner, and writing over one of those
// leaves that owner's records describing a file that is no longer there. So the
// first thing this does is work out which of the two it is looking at, and the
// second is refuse loudly if it is the wrong one.
//
// The second fact is that tuios-web is a separate binary that talks to the same
// daemon, and the daemon compares build strings and warns when they differ. An
// update that moved one and not the other would manufacture exactly the
// mismatch that warning exists to catch, so the pair moves together or not at
// all: both are downloaded and verified before either is put in place.
